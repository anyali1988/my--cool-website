    <img class="safety" src="images/safety.png" alt="safety">
    <p>HSE (Health, Safety and Environment) is a set of processes and procedures identifying potential hazards to a certain environment, developing best practices to reduce or remove those hazards, and then training employees for accident prevention, accident response, etc.

      The major intent of having a HSE (Health, Safety and Environment) Management System dates back in time to the faulty working practices of workers in an earlier era, especially in the manufacturing industry. Employees were barely protected from the accidents caused by the machines and equipment they worked with. As a result, there was a high rate of accidents that led to injuries and even death of the employees. Eventually, the workers began to demand better safety and forced the government to take action. The governments responded by introducing legislation requiring employers to assure workplace health and safety, pay for medical insurance and other compensation for injuries, death and illness resulting from work activities.As a professional i will definitely bring my expertise on board with so much committment.</p>
